    Welcome, welcome, WELCOME to the first annual Tater Tot Challenge. 
    This alllll began on one gorgeous summer day. I was sitting on the beach with my friend, who was working as an 
    umbrella girl at the Beautiful Bethany Beach. A man came up to the stand to us and so innocently inquired, 
    "Joey Chestnut ate 62 hot dogs in 10 minutes this summer. 
    Do you ladies think you could eat 62 tater tots in 10 minutes." 
    We looked at each other, and all we could do was laugh. He had no idea who he was talking to, 
    or what he had just created. We said, "Sir, we could do it in five." And that day, 
    The Tater Tot Challenge was born.
