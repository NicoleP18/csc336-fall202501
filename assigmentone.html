   <i>My summer was filled with a mulitude of fun things.
    <br> 
    Here is a quick glimpse into what I have been up to— or at least the highlights!
    </i>

<h2 style="background-color: rgb(248, 103, 175); -webkit-text-fill-color: aliceblue;" > <b>Working</b> </h2>

<p> I worked in Dr. Harry's Lab this summer at AU. He, and the lab, work in collaboration with <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a> and we specifically work on the optics. 
    I learned so much from both him and the research, and it just was an incredible experience overall! 
 </p>

<h3><u>Al Dente</u></h3>

    I also worked at Al Dente this summer. It is super close to the lab, so it made my travel from place to place easy! 
    I had to memorize all the <a href=https://www.aldentedc.com/menus/#all-day-menu>menus</a> in the first week which was a challenge.
    These are my favorite items:
    <ul>
        <li>Mezzi Rigatoni</li>
        <li>Pepperoni Pizza <b><u>WITH</u></b> an egg</li>
        <li>Bolognese</li>   
    </ul>
</p>

I have worked in DaBL since my sophomore year, and this summer, we got the opportunity to go to
<a href="https://isam2025.hemi-makers.org/" >ISAM </a>,
which stands for International Symposium on Academic Makerspaces. It was in Berkeley/San Francisco and it was <u><i><b>awesome!</b></i></u>
The website describes the conference as, <q>The International Symposium on Academic Makerspaces (ISAM) is 
the preeminent annual meeting for the academic makerspace community. Over a span of 3 days, 300+ faculty, staff, student, 
and industry leaders gather to share makerspace knowledge, experience and inspiration in order to maximize impact on (i) the 
student learning experience and (ii) alumni success.</q>

<h3><b><u>Beaching</u></b></h3>

I went to the Dominican Republic with my family. We had an incredible time and it was so beautiful!

    I got to see two of my favorite bands this summer: Caamp and Houndmouth. I have seen them both before, (this is my <b>FOURTH</b> time seeing Caamp)
    but I listen to their music all the time, so I absolutely love getting to hear them live. 
    These are my top three favorite songs by each of them:
    <h3>Caamp</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Hey Joe</li>
        <li>By and By</li>
        <li>Millions</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Houndmouth</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Southside</li>
        <li>Ludlow</li>
        <li>Darlin</li>
    </ol>

    I have a huge extended family and two of my cousins got married this summer. 
    It was so nice to see all of my cousins and family, as it is usually difficult to get everyone in one place!
